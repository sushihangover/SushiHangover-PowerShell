SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the PSRSS module in the Windows 7 Resource Kit.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The PSSS module contains functions that manage and edit RSS feeds and the
    the articles in the feeds.

    The PSRSS module adds the following functions to your session when you import
    the module.

        New-Feed              Subscribes to an RSS feed and downloads the articles.
        Remove-Feed           Unsubscribes to an RSS feed and deletes the articles.
        Get-Feed              Gets the RSS feeds on your system.

        Get-Article           Gets articles in the RSS feeds on your system.
        Read-Article          Marks articles as read.
        Remove-Article        Deletes articles from your system.


    For information about these functions, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example,
    to get detailed help for the Get-Feed function, type "get-help get-feed -detailed."

    The functions in the PSRSS module uses COM based on the the Microsoft.FeedsManager
    class in the Windows RSS platform. These functions are implemented as scripts, but
    are available in the session as functions.
