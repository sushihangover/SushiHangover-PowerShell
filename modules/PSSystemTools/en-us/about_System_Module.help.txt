LONG DESCRIPTION
    The System module contains functions that get information about the operating
    system on the local and remote computers.
    
    The System module adds the following functions to your session when you import
    the module.

        Get-BootStatus                Gets information about how the system was started, e.g. Safe Mode
        Get-DisplaySetting            Gets the width and height of the primary monitor.
        Get-LogicalDiskInventory      Gets the logical disks on the local and remote computers.
        Get-MultiTouchMaximum         Gets the number of fingers that can be used on a multitouch device.
        Get-OSVersion                 Gets the operating system Version of a local or remote computer.
        Get-Processor                 Gets processor information for local and remote computers.
        Get-WindowsEdition            Gets the operating system edition.
        Test-32Bit                    Returns TRUE when the computer has a 32-bit processor architecture.
        Test-64Bit                    Returns TRUE when the computer has a 64-bit processor architecture.


    For information about these functions, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example,
    to get detailed help for the Get-Feed function, type "get-help get-bootstatus -detailed."

    These functions are implemented in the module as scripts, but are available in the session
    as functions.
