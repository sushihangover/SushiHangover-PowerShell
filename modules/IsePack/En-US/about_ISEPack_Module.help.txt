SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the ISEPack module in the Windows 7 Resource Kit.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The ISEPack module adds menu items to the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting
    Environment (ISE). This module has no effect on the Windows PowerShell console or
    other host programs.

    To use the module, start Windows PowerShell ISE and then use the Import-Module
    cmdlet to add the module to your session. The command is:

        import-module isepack

    To use the module in every Windows PowerShell ISE session, add the 
    "Import-Module ISEPack" command to a Windows PowerShell ISE profile. For more
    information, see "How to Use Profiles in Windows PowerShell ISE"
    (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd819434.aspx). 

    The ISEPack module also adds to your session the functions that make the commands
    work. You can use these functions in your session and you can examine the function
    code to learn how to customize Windows PowerShell ISE. To find these functions, after
    importing the ISEPaCK module, type:

        get-command -module isepack


 MENU ITEMS
    The ISEPack module adds the following menu items to Windows PowerShell ISE.   


    ISEPack Menu:  Click Add-Ons, ISEPack

        Export-FormatView    (CTRL+ALT+F)
           Creates a view definition for a type that includes only the properties that
           you specify and exports the definition. Use this command to create a view
           definition for a Windows PowerShell Format.ps1xml file. For more information,
           see about_Format_ps1xml.
          
       Invoke-Line    (F6)
           Executes a line of code from a script. To use this command, place the cursor
           on any line in the Script pane and then use Invoke-Line.

       Show-HelpForCurrentSelection    (CTRL+ALT+H)
           Displays the full version of help at the command line for text that is
           selected in any pane. Unlike F1, this command does not open the Windows
           PowerShell Help compiled help file.

       Show-Member    (ALT+M)
           Displays the properties and methods of the selected objects in an interactive
           grid view window. To use this command, select a variable, command, or script
           block that defines an object, such as "get-process powershell_ise", in any
           pane, and then use Show-Member.

       Show-SyntaxForCurrentCommand    (ALT+Y)
           Displays the syntax diagram for the selected commands. To use this command, 
           select cmdlet, alias, or function names in any pane, and then use 
           Show-SyntaxForCurrentCommand.

       Show-TypeConstructorForCurrentType    (ALT+C)

    Edit Menu:  Click Add-Ons, ISEPack, Edit

           in the script and saves it in the current directory.

        ClearOutput     (F12)
           Deletes all content from the output pane. Same as CLS and the 
           "Clear Output Pane" tool.

           Converts the current script into a function and displays it in
           a new file. The name of the function is the name of the script
           (without the .ps1 file name extension).

        Copy-Colored    (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
           Copies text and its color from the Script pane. You can select text and
           then copy. By default, it copies all text in the Script pane. This function
           lets you paste the syntax-colored script into other programs, such as Microsoft
           Word.
           
        Copy-ColoredAsHtml    (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+C)
           Copies text and its color from the Script pane and converts it to HTML
           format. You can select text and then copy. By default, it copies all text
           in the Script pane. This function lets you paste the syntax-colored script
           into an HTML document. 

        Copy-FilePathToClipboard    (CTRL+P)
           Copies the full path and file name of the current script. If the script 
           has not yet been saved, it uses the default name (Untitled*) and the 
           current directory.

        Move-ToNextGroup    (ALT+SHIFT+RIGHT)
           Moves your cursor to the next code group in the script. This command helps
           you to move between logical sections of a script that you are viewing or 
           editng.

        Move-ToLastGroup    (ALT+SHIFT+LEFT)
           Moves the cursor to the last code group in the script. This command helps
           you to move between logical sections of a script that you are viewing or 
           editng.

        Move-ToLastGroup    (ALT+SHIFT+LEFT)
           Moves the cursor to the last code group in the script. This command helps
           you to move between logical sections of a script that you are viewing or 
           editng.

        Profile             (CTRL+E)

        Split-CurrentFile    (CTRL+ALT+MINUS)
           Splits a script with many functions into a many scripts with one function
           each. This command copies each function in the script to a separate file. 
           The original script is not changed.

	Toggle Comments     (CTRL+ALT+C)
           Adds the comment symbok to uncommented lines and deletes the comment symbol (#)
           from commented lines . To use this command, select lines of code in the current
           script and use "Toggle Comments". 



    Modules Menu:   Click Add-Ons, ISEPack, Modules

        Import-CurrentModule     (CTRL+ALT+M)
           Imports the module that contains the current script or function. This           
           command works when the code in the current script includes a function that
           comes from a module. The function must have been run at least once before
           using the command.

        New-ScriptModuleFromCurrentLocation
           Creates a script module (.psm1) that includes the current script and all
           .ps1 files that are in the same directory as the script. The module is named
           for the directory. The command works only when the current script is saved in
           a .ps1 file and a .psm1 file with the directory name does not already exist in
           the directory.

        Move-ToNextPowerShellTab    (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+RIGHT)
           Displays the PowerShell tab to the right of the current tab. Because each 
           PowerShell tab has its own session, this command works only in PowerShell
           tabs in which the ISEPack module has been imported. To enable this command in
           all PowerShell tabs, add the Import-Module command to your Windows PowerShell
           profile.                

        Move-ToLastPowerShellTab    (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+LEFT)

           contains the current script. To return to the original location, use the
           Pop-Location cmdlet ("popd").

        Rename-CurrentPowerShellTab    (CTRL+ALT+N)
           Prompts you for a new name for the current PowerShell tab.

           Adds an If statement to the current script. Use an IF statement to 
           perform an action only when specified conditions are met.

        Add-InlineHelp    (ALT + H)
           Adds comment-based help to the current script. For information about the 
           placement of comment-based help, see about_comment-based_help.

        Add-Parameter    (ALT + P)
           Adds a Parameter statement to the current script. For information about

    variable.
