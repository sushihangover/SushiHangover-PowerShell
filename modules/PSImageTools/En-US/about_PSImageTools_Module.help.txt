SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the PSImageTools module in the Windows 7 Resource Kit.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The PSImageTools module contains functions that manage and edit image files, such
    as photographs, in Windows PowerShell. 

    The PSImageTools module adds the following basic functions to your session
    when you import the module.


        Get-Image              Gets image objects with many useful properties. Provides
                               methods to load, save, crop, resize, rotate, and flip images.
                               
        Get-ImageProperty      Gets extended properties for the image, such as shutter speed
                               and resolution.

        Copy-ImageIntoOrganizedFolder
                               Creates a set of folders based on properties that you specify
                               and copies image files into the folders based on their
                               property values.

        ConvertTo-Bitmap       Converts images to bitmap format (.bmp).
        ConvertTo-Jpeg         Converts images to JPEG format (.jpg, .jpeg).


    The PSImageTools module also adds filtering functions to your session. You can use these
    more advanced functions to edit images when the basic functions do not provide a feature
    that you need.

    The Add-*Filter functions create a Windows Image Acquisition filter that represents a change to one or
    more images. The filters alone do not change images. To apply a filter to an image, use
    the Set-ImageFilter function.

        Add-CropFilter         Creates a filter that crops images.
        Add-OverlayFilter      Creates a filter that overlays one image on another.
        Add-RotateFlipFilter   Creates a filter that rotate and flips images.
        Add-ScaleFilter        Creates a filter that resizes images.

        Set-ImageFilter        Edits an image by applying a filter. 

    For information about these functions, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example,
    to get detailed help for the Get-Image function, type "get-help get-image -detailed."

    These functions are implemented as scripts, but are available in the 
    session as functions.
